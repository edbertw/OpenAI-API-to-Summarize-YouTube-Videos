# YouTube Transcripts and OpenAI API For Summarizing YouTube Videos
## About
The code in this repository uses YouTube Transcripts API to collect Video Transcripts and ID from a parsed URL. Then, It utilised the OpenAI API Secret Key to run the pretrained ```gpt-3.5-turbo``` model with a few fine-tuning of parameters to handle the summarizing of the transcripts. Finally, this program is deployed to a web application using the Python streamlit library for a more interactive user interface. Users can simply run the program and enter the command ```streamlit run main.py``` on the command line to open the webview of the deployed program. There, Users can simply enter a YouTube Video Link, obtained from the search bar of any Web Browsers, and a detailed summary will be displayed on the web app.
